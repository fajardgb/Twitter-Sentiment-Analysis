### Data and Saved Models
Original Datasets and Saved Models are at this [link](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1k71Mx3KeGK1w-ng4rxTgDiCJjGrnddDC?usp=share_link) 

### Description of the Dataset
Original dataset consisted of 1.6 million tweets that were classified into either 0:"NEGATIVE" or 4:"POSITIVE". As some of the baselines we used could not handle such large amounts of tweets, we randomly sampled 25000 "NEGATIVE tweets and 25000 "POSITIVE" tweets from the dataset. The original dataset can be found at this [kaggle link](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kazanova/sentiment140) 

### Running Twitter API Notebook
To run the twitter api notebook, you will need to have your own set of twitter api keys. 

### Running GPT-3 OpenAI API Notebook
The fine-tuned GPT-3 model is associated with Kenny Wang's OpenAI account, so you will need to use his API Key for the notebook to run.
