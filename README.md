### Description of the Dataset
Original dataset consisted of 1.6 million tweets that were classified into either 0:"NEGATIVE" or 4:"POSITIVE". As some of the baselines we used could not handle such large amounts of tweets, we randomly sampled 25000 "NEGATIVE tweets and 25000 "POSITIVE" tweets from the dataset.
